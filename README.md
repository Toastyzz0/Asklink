# What is "Leaf-Link"? 
Asklink is a Multi-Task Tool Website that allows you to talk with the community, Play / Stream Music, Watch Free Movies, and More!

Like the Warning said, this is a Beta verson so, Expect bugs.

# How does LeafLink work?
Asklink works by having different pages that do different stuff. Some pages require you to Create an account / Login but, Asklink doesn't store your info. And most pages don't need to have a login.

We also have a strong mangers so anything that breaks the rules will have you getting banned.
